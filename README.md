# MovieStageTwo
This application is for Movie Stage two of my Nanodegree course which is an extension of Stage one. It supports design for both phone and tablets devices. In order to run this project successfully you will need to get yourself an API Key from www.themoviedb.org website and place it in its placeholder in Constants.java file.
